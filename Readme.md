# On the beach code challenge - IW

My code challenge for on the beach

## Some notes on thinking throughout

* Step 1: Get unit tests loaded, failing
* Step 2: Get an unordered array of the input string loaded. I've assumed that I can't rely on splitting on "\n", i.e. a=>b=>c is valid. Probably lends itself to recursion... but my brain
* Step 3: Get simple case (no dependencies) returning in expected format
* Step 4: Extend simple case
